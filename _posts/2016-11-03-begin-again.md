## What is going on here?

Following the advice of other smart people; that's what. I wanted an easy way to link resources that I wish to share. Also, perhaps, 
re-share some older content and random thoughts. I didn't want to use a canned blog or write my own, so I'm trying Github pages with Jekyll. Wish me luck!
