## remote freelancing posts

I like to work on side projects along with my regular workload, and there was a recent discussion on HN about site.
Upwork is getting a bad name; entirely deserved if you ask me. Instead, here are a couple links with contain even more links, 
which link to relevant job posts. I'm just going to leave this here for my future self, and anyone else who may find it
helpful.
